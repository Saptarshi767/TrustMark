This is a legitimate educational blockchain analysis platform that helps users 
understand Ethereum transaction patterns. The site:

- Only analyzes public blockchain data from Etherscan API
- Does not handle private keys or financial transactions  
- Is designed for educational and demonstration purposes
- Implements proper security measures (HTTPS, CSP, security headers)
- Has a clear security policy at /security-policy

This appears to be a false positive, possibly due to:
1. Being hosted on Vercel's shared infrastructure
2. Recent deployment triggering automated scanning
3. Web3/blockchain content being misidentified

Please review and remove from the blocklist. Thank you.

Hello Vercel Support,

My legitimate project at https://trust-mark.vercel.app is being flagged by 
Google Safe Browsing as dangerous, likely due to a false positive.

This is affecting the user experience of my educational blockchain analysis tool. 
The site contains no malicious content and implements proper security measures.

Could you please:
1. Check if there are any known IP reputation issues affecting vercel.app domains
2. Advise on best practices for avoiding such false positives  
3. Escalate to Google if this is a platform-wide issue

The project is open source and available for review.

Thank you for your assistance.
