# Login Page Security Fixes

## Security Issues Addressed

The login page has been hardened against common security vulnerabilities that were causing Chrome to flag it as dangerous. All fixes are implemented internally without changing the core functionality.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP)
- **Enhanced CSP headers** with nonce-based script execution
- **Strict resource loading** from trusted CDNs only
- **Blocked inline scripts** without proper nonce
- **Frame protection** to prevent clickjacking
- **Upgrade insecure requests** to HTTPS

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- **Real-time Ethereum address validation** with regex patterns
- **Client-side input sanitization** removing invalid characters
- **Server-side validation** with enhanced checks
- **Pattern matching** for 42-character hex addresses
- **Visual feedback** for valid/invalid inputs

### 3. Rate Limiting Protection
- **IP-based rate limiting** for login attempts
- **Session-based limits** for API endpoints
- **MetaMask connection attempts** limited to prevent abuse
- **Nonce request limits** to prevent DoS attacks
- **Authentication attempt limits** with cooldown periods

### 4. Enhanced Authentication Security
- **Increased nonce entropy** (32 bytes vs 16 bytes)
- **Nonce expiration** (5 minutes maximum)
- **Signature validation** with format checks
- **Address verification** with checksum validation
- **Session cleanup** on successful authentication

### 5. HTTP Security Headers
- **Strict-Transport-Security** for HTTPS enforcement
- **X-Content-Type-Options** to prevent MIME sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options** to prevent embedding
- **X-XSS-Protection** for legacy browser protection
- **Cross-Origin policies** for resource isolation
- **Referrer-Policy** for privacy protection

### 6. Form Security
- **CSRF token protection** (when available)
- **Autocomplete disabled** for sensitive fields
- **Double-submission prevention** with button disabling
- **Input length limits** and character restrictions
- **Spellcheck disabled** for address fields

### 7. JavaScript Security
- **Nonce-based script execution** for CSP compliance
- **Request timeouts** to prevent hanging connections
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Abort controllers** for request cancellation
- **Input validation** before form submission

### 8. CDN Resource Security
- **Integrity checks** (SRI) for external resources
- **Crossorigin attributes** for secure loading
- **Trusted CDN sources** only (jsdelivr.net)
- **Fallback handling** for resource loading failures

### 9. User Agent Protection
- **Suspicious bot detection** and blocking
- **Legitimate crawler allowlist** (Google, Bing)
- **Request pattern analysis** for abuse detection

### 10. Error Handling
- **Secure error messages** without sensitive information
- **Rate limit notifications** for users
- **Graceful degradation** when features fail
- **Logging** for security monitoring

## Security Benefits

1. **Prevents XSS attacks** through CSP and input validation
2. **Blocks CSRF attacks** with token protection
3. **Mitigates DoS attacks** through rate limiting
4. **Prevents clickjacking** with frame protection
5. **Ensures data integrity** with input validation
6. **Protects user privacy** with secure headers
7. **Prevents session hijacking** with secure cookies
8. **Blocks malicious bots** with user agent filtering

## Browser Compatibility

All security measures are implemented to maintain compatibility with:
- Chrome/Chromium browsers
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge
- Mobile browsers

## Testing Recommendations

1. Test login with valid Ethereum addresses
2. Verify rate limiting works after multiple attempts
3. Check CSP compliance in browser developer tools
4. Validate MetaMask integration still functions
5. Confirm error messages are user-friendly
6. Test form submission with various inputs

## Monitoring

The application now logs security events for monitoring:
- Failed authentication attempts
- Rate limit violations
- Invalid input submissions
- Suspicious user agent requests

These fixes should resolve Chrome's security warnings while maintaining full functionality.
