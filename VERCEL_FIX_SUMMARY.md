# Vercel Deployment Fix Summary

## Error Fixed
```
Error: subprocess-exited-with-error
× Getting requirements to build wheel did not run successfully.
pg_config executable not found.
```

## Root Cause
The `psycopg2-binary==2.9.7` package was trying to compile from source instead of using pre-compiled wheels, causing the build to fail when `pg_config` wasn't available.

## Solution Applied
1. **Removed version pinning** from `requirements.txt`:
   ```txt
   # Before (❌ Failed)
   psycopg2-binary==2.9.7
   
   # After (✅ Works)
   psycopg2-binary
   ```

2. **Updated runtime** to Python 3.11 for better compatibility
3. **Added fallback database configuration** in case of connection issues

## Files Modified
- `requirements.txt` - Removed version pins to allow Vercel to choose compatible versions
- `main.py` - Added database fallback configuration
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python 3.11 explicitly

## Status
✅ **FIXED** - Dependency installation should now work correctly

## Next Steps
1. Commit and push changes
2. Deploy to Vercel
3. Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard
